## Image Denoising using Convolutional Autoencoders

In this notebook I've used Convolutional Autoencoders to denoise MNIST image data, as well as deployed simple CNN for classification.
Firstly the noise has been added to the image data and afterwards it has been reconstructed by using CAE. 

CNN achieved the accuracy of 0,99.

The image data from MNIST before and after adding the noise looks as shown below
