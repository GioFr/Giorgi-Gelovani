On this page I demosntrate some of the projects I have been working on. All the projects are related to Data Science, Machine Learning and different AI topics.

## Image Denoising using Convolutional Autoencoders

In this notebook I've used Convolutional Autoencoders to denoise MNIST image data, as well as deployed simple CNN for classification.
Firstly the noise has been added to the image data and afterwards it has been reconstructed by using CAE. 

CNN achieved the accuracy of 0,99.

After applying CAE to noisy MNIST data we get well recovered/denoised images,which is shown below
